To maintain consistency throughout the site, I used the following notations and rules.


- Matrices: By bold upper case letter. For example: $\mathbf{A}$
- Vector: By bold smaller case letter. For example : $\mathbf{x}$
- Element of a vector: smaller case letter followed by subscript. For example: $x_1$
