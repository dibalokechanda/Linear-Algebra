Let's start with the definition,  Consider a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$

$$
\operatorname{ker}(\mathbf{A}):=\left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}= \mathbf{0}\right\} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n
$$

**Interpretation:** 
 - All the vectors  $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$  are going through the transformation $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$.
 - A set of vectors $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is getting mapped to $\mathbf{0}$ after the transformation.
 
Let's visualize this with an image :

We can see that the zero vector is always going to be included in the Kernel. This is obvious, because if in the transformation $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$ , the vector $\mathbf{x}$ is $\mathbf{0}$, the resultant value is $\mathbf{0}$.
## Connecting to Null Space 

The kernel of a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ forms a subspace in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The subspace is known as the null space of $\mathbf{A}$.




> The following can be thought of equivalent:
> $$ \operatorname{Ker}(\mathbf{A}) \equiv \operatorname{Null}(\mathbf{A}) $$
