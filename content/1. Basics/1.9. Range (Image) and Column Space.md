Let's start with the definition. Consider a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$  and remember what it meant by $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ from [[1.1. Matrix Vector Multiplication|Matrix Vector Multiplication]].

Based on this we can define the range (also known as the image) of a matrix transformation as follows: 
$$
\text{Range}(\mathbf{A}):= \{\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{m}
$$
**Interpretation:** 
 - All the vectors  $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$  are going through the transformation $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$.
 - After going through the transformation, every vector $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are getting mapped to a subspace in $\mathbb{R}^m$.
 - That particular subspace in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is called the Range of $\mathbf{A}$ (or the Image of $\mathbf{A}$).
A nice way to interpret this is with a Venn diagram of the vectors spaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$.

This means range is the subspace where the vectors gets mapped to after the transformation. Consider the following equation:

$$
\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
$$
Here, if we consider every possible $\mathbf{x}$, the generated $\mathbf{b}$ vectors construct a subspace. That subspace is the range (or image) of $\mathbf{A}$.


## Connecting to Column space

Based on [[1.1. Matrix Vector Multiplication|Matrix Vector Multiplication]] discussion, we can intuit that, the subspace we are taking about when we say $\text{Range}(\mathbf{A})$ is actually the column space of $\mathbf{A}$.

Because $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$ can be interpreted as the linear combination of the columns of $\mathbf{A}$. That means, by taking the linear combination of columns of $\mathbf{A}$, we are forming subspace which is know as the column space. And, the name is self-explanatory because the subspace is constructed by taking the linear combination of columns of $\mathbf{A}$.

We can also relate this with the idea of [[1.6. Span|Span]]. 


$$
\mathbf{A}=\left[\begin{array}{cccc}
\mid & \mid & & \mid \\
\mathbf{a}_{1} & \mathbf{a}_{2} & \ldots & \mathbf{a}_{n} \\
\mid & \mid & & \mid
\end{array}\right]
$$

The subspace that is spanned by the columns of $\mathbf{A}$ is the column space. Mathematically,

$$
\operatorname{Range}(\mathbf{A})=\operatorname{span}(\mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{a}_{2},\cdots,\mathbf{a}_{n})
$$



> All of the following can be thought of equivalent:
> $$ \operatorname{Col}(\mathbf{A}) \equiv \operatorname{Range}(\mathbf{A}) \equiv \operatorname{Im}(\mathbf{A}) $$
