Let's start with the definition. Consider a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$  and remember what it meant by $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}$ from [[1.1. Matrix Vector Multiplication|Matrix Vector Multiplication]].

Based on this we can define the range (also known as the image) of a matrix as follows: 
$$
\text{Range}(\mathbf{A}):= \{\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{m}
$$
**Interpretation:** 
 - All the vectors  $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$  are going through the transformation $\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}$.
 - After going through the transformation, every vector $\mathbf{x}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ are getting mapped to a subspace in $\mathbb{R}^m$.
 - That particular subspace in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is called the Range of $\mathbf{A}$ (or the Image of $\mathbf{A}$).

A nice way to interpret this is with a Venn diagram of the vectors spaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\mathbb{R}^m$.
