Direct sum of two subspace (or vector space)  $W$ and $U$ is denoted by $W \oplus U$. 

Say, $V$ is the resultant subspace from the direct sum. To be a valid direct sum the following two properties need to hold:

- $V=W+U$  where $v \in V, w \in W, u \in U$ 

$$
v=w+u
$$
- $W \cap U = \{ \mathbf{0} \}$

**Another interpretation of this definition is** :  $v=w+u$ can be uniquely written. 

Consider two subspaces $W$ and $U$.

Here, the subspace $W$ contains vector of the form shown below:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ c
\end{bmatrix}
$$
And, the subspace $U$ contains vector  of the form shown below:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a  \\
b  \\
0
\end{bmatrix}

$$
Visualization of direction sum is given below:

We can clearly see that, when we add $w \in W$ and $u \in U$, there is only one way they can be added. And the resultant $v \in V$ will have the following form:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
a  \\
b   \\
c
\end{bmatrix}
$$
