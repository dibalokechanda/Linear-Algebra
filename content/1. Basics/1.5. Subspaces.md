## Definition

A subspace $\mathbb{W}$ of a vector space is a subset with special closure property.  Formally, a subspace $\mathbb{W}\subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$ is a set that is closed under addition operation ($+$)  and scalar multiplication. 


> [!note] Though it is not explicitly mentioned, all subspaces considered are linear subspaces.


**Properties that need to hold for a valid subspace:** 
- $\mathbf{0}$ is included in the subspace 

$$
\mathbf{0}=\begin{bmatrix}
 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{W}
$$
- For all, $\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}\in \mathbb{W}$; $\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2} \in \mathbb{W}$. This means the subspace is closed under addition operation. In other words, if we pick any two vectors from the subspace, the resultant vector from addition of those two vectors is also in the subspace.
- For all $\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb{W}$ and $\alpha\in \mathbb{C}$; $\alpha \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{W}$. This means the subspace is closed under scalar multiplication.

> [!tip] The subspace must be a non-empty set.
