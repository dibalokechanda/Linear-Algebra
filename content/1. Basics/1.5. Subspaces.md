## Definition

A subspace $\mathbb{W}$ of a vector space is a subset with special closure property.  Formally, a subspace $\mathbb{W}\subseteq \mathbb{C}^n$ is a set that is closed under addition operation ($+$)  and scalar multiplication. 


> [!note] Though it is not explicitly mentioned, all subspaces considered are linear subspaces.


**Properties that need to hold for a valid subspace:** 
- $\mathbf{0}$ is included in the subspace.

$$
\mathbf{0}=\begin{bmatrix}
 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{W}
$$
- For all, $\mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2}\in \mathbb{W}$; $\mathbf{v_1}+\mathbf{v_2} \in \mathbb{W}$. This means **the subspace is closed under addition operation**. In other words, if we pick any two vectors from the subspace, the resultant vector from addition of those two vectors is also in the subspace.
- For all $\mathbf{v}\in \mathbb{W}$ and $\alpha\in \mathbb{C}$; $\alpha \mathbf{v} \in \mathbb{W}$. This means **the subspace is closed under scalar multiplication**.

> [!tip] The subspace must be a non-empty set.

## Visual Intuition of Subspaces

Even though subspaces is quite a general concept, it's good to get some visual intuition in lower dimensions.

Consider the following diagram which shows a subspace $\mathbb{W}^2$ for a vector space in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In such case the subspace is a infinite line going through the origin. As it goes through the origin, the $\mathbf{0}$ is included in the subspace. In addition, it follows the other two criteria also.

For a vector space in $\mathbb{R}^3$, a valid subspace is  infinite plane going through the origin.  A visualization is given below:

One example of an invalid subspace is a affine subspace which is a infinite line that does not go through the origin. Also, based on the geometric intuition mentioned above, we can easily visualize some other examples of invalid subspaces.
