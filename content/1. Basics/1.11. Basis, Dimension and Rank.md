## Basis 

> [!hint] Basis for vector space vs subspace
> Basis can be defined both for vector spaces and subspaces. But usually if nothing is mentioned it is typical to infer them as basis for vector space.

###  Definition:

Basis of a vector space (subspace) $V$  is a set of vectors $S$ that are:

- Linearly independent. 
- Spans the entire vector space i.e.  $\operatorname{span}(S)=V$

> [!check]  Every basis of a given vector space has the same size.


> [!caution] Basis vectors do not need to be orthogonal.
> It is common to develop this misconception, because most of the time the basis we work with are orthogonal. They are referred to as orthogonal basis. But in general basis do not need to be orthogonal.


In a sense, basis is the **most efficient spanning set** for vector space (or subspace).  By most efficient, I mean there is "no redundant vector" which can be formed from the other vectors in the basis set.

Let's go through a concrete example to get a better understanding. Let's restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^3$.  

Consider two vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$, 

$$
\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 1 \\0
\end{bmatrix}\right\}
$$

- **Are they linearly independent?** : Yes,  because it is not possible to generate one vector from the other by taking linear combination. In other word, one vector in this set do lie in the span of the other vector.
- **Do they span the entire vector space** $\mathbb{R}^3$ : No, because they span of these two vectors only fills in a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^3$, not the entire $\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore, it is not possible to generate any vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ by taking the linear combination of these two vectors.

Now consider the following three vectors:


$$
\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 1 \\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
1  \\
1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}\right\}
$$
- **Are they linearly independent?**:  Yes. 
- **Do they span the entire vector space** $\mathbb{R}^3$ : Yes

| ---- | ---- |
| Linearly Independent Set | ✔️ |
| Basis | ✔️ |
| Spanning Set | ✔️ |

Now consider the following four vectors: 

$$
\left\{ \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 0 \\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
1 \\ 1 \\0
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
1  \\
1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}
2  \\
2 \\
2
\end{bmatrix}\right\}
$$

 - **Are they linearly independent?**:  No. Because we have a redundant vector $\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1\end{bmatrix}^{\top}$, which can be formed by linear combination of the other vectors.
- **Do they span the entire vector space** $\mathbb{R}^3$ : Yes. Even though there is a redundant vector, these vectors span the entire $\mathbb{R}^3$.

| ---- | ---- |
| Linearly Independent Set | ❌ |
| Basis | ❌ |
| Spanning Set | ✔️ |

Based on the discussion above we can claim the following:

$$
\mid \text{Linearly Independent Set}\mid ~\leq ~\mid \text{Basis} \mid ~\leq ~\mid \text{Spanning Set}\mid 
$$

This means:

- Every spanning set contains a basis.
- Every linearly independent set can be extended to a basis.
