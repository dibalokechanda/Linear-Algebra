> [!hint] Basis for vector space vs subspace
> Basis can be defined both for vector spaces and subspaces. But usually if nothing is mentioned it is typical to infer them as basis for vector space.

###  Definition:

Basis of a vector space (subspace) $V$  is a set of vectors $S$ that are:

- Linearly independent. 
- Spans the entire vector space i.e.  $\operatorname{span}(S)=V$

Some interesting facts about basis:

- Every basis of a given vector space has the same size.
- Every spanning set contains a basis.
- Every linearly independent set can be extended to a basis. 


> [!caution] Basis vectors do not need to be orthogonal.
> It is common to develop this misconception, because most of the time the basis we work with are orthogonal. They are referred to as orthogonal basis. But in general basis do not need to orthogonal.
