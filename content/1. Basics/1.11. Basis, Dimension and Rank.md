> [!hint] Basis for vector space vs subspace
> Basis can be defined both for vector spaces and subspaces. But usually if nothing is mentioned it is typical to infer them as basis for vector space.

###  Definition:

Basis of a vector space (subspace) $V$  is a set of vectors $S$ that are:

- Linearly independent. 
- Spans the entire vector space i.e.  $\operatorname{span}(S)=V$
