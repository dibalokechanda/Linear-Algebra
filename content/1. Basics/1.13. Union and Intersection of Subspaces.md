## Union of subspaces


$$
\boxed{\text{Union of two subspaces is not a subspace}}
$$



To get a concrete example, let's restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^2$ an consider two subspaces $W$ and $U$.

Visually we can see of we take any two vector from $W$ and $U$, the summation of them is not contained in $W \cup U$.
 
## Intersection of subspaces
