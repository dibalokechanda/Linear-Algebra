## Union of subspaces

$$
\boxed{\text{Union of two subspaces is not a subspace}}
$$
Mathematically, if $U$ and $W$ are two subspaces then $U \cup W$ is not a valid subspace.

To get a concrete example, let's restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^2$ an consider two subspaces $W$ and $U$.

Visually we can see of we take any two vector from $W$ and $U$, the summation of them is not contained in $W \cup U$.

## Intersection of subspaces

$$
\boxed{\text{Intersection of two subspaces is a subspace}}
$$

Mathematically, if $U$ and $W$ are two subspaces then $U \cap W$ is also a subspace.
