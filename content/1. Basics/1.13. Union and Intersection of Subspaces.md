## Union of subspaces

$$
\boxed{\text{Union of two subspaces is not a subspace}}
$$
Mathematically, if $W$ and $U$ are two subspaces then $W \cup U$ is not a valid subspace.

To get a concrete example, let's restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^2$ an consider two subspaces $W$ and $U$. In $\mathbb{R}^2$ two subspaces are represented by two infinite lines going through the origin.

Visually we can see of we take any two vector from $W$ and $U$, the summation of them is not contained in $W \cup U$.

It also holds true in $\mathbb{R}^3$ where the two subspaces are two planes going through the origin.

## Intersection of subspaces

$$
\boxed{\text{Intersection of two subspaces is a subspace}}
$$

Mathematically, if $W$ and $U$ are two subspaces then $W \cap U$ is also a subspace.

To get a concrete example, let's restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^2$ an consider two subspaces $W$ and $U$. The intersection will only contain the zero vector. We know that $\mathbf{0}$ is subspace.

In $\mathbb{R}^3$, the intersection is a line that goes through the origin which is subspace itself.
