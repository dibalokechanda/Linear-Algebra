To get a concrete example, let's restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^2$ an consider two subspaces $W$ and $U$.

Visually we can come up with the following conclusions:

- Union of two subspaces is closed under scalar multiplication
- Union of two subspaces contains the zero vector.
- But union of two subspaces is not closed under addition.
