## Direct Sum of Subspaces

### Definition 
Direct sum of two subspace (or vector space)  $X$ and $Y$ is denoted by $X \oplus Y$. Say, $V$ is the resultant subspace from the direct sum. To be a valid direct sum the following two properties need to hold:

- $V=X+Y$ then for $v \in V, x \in X, y \in Y$

$$
v=x+y
$$
- $X \cap Y = \{ \mathbf{0} \}$
