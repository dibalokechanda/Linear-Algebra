title: 1.3. Matrix Multiplication as Transformation
draft: false

---
In this section, I will go through different types of matrices and visualize what transformation happens when we apply that matrix to vectors. 


> [!important] Considerations
>  - Obviously, these transformations can be generalized to any vector space of $\mathbb{C}^n$. But for the ease of visualization I will keep it limited to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
>  - In addition, based on the discussion in [[1.1. Matrix Vector Multiplication|Matrix Vector Multiplication]] and [[1.2. Linearity|Linearity]]  it is pretty obvious, understanding how the basis vectors transforms is all we require to get a intuition about the transformation.
>  -  Hence, I will illustrate all the vectors within one unit distance from the origin with a colored rectangle.


**Other Online Interactive Tools to visualize:**

- [Linear Transformations Demo Applet by Lauren K Williams](https://www.integral-domain.org/lwilliams/Applets/algebra/linearTransformations.php)
- [Matrix Arcade by YI ZHE ANG](https://yizhe-ang.github.io/matrix-explorable//)

I think  playing with these tools is the best way to appreciate matrices as transformations.

> [!Caution] Caution about terminology
> Note that some of the terminology used in this page is not standarized. Word like "Stretching" or "Scaling" can be interpreted in different ways and sometimes you might need to perform some mental gymnastics to adapt.

## Identity matrix
----
$$
 I_n = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 \end{bmatrix} 
$$
By definition, identity matrix is a square matrix with $1$ along the diagonals.
When we apply identity matrix to any vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$,  nothing actually happens and the all the vectors stays where it was originally.

The reason behind that is, every column of the identity matrix is the standard basis vectors. 

## Diagonal matrices | Scaling Transformations
-----
A diagonal matrix has non-zero diagonal elements ($d_{ii}\neq 0$). All the off-diagonal elements are zero ($d_{ij}=0; i\neq j$). And, by definition we will consider it a square matrix.

$$
D = \begin{bmatrix} d_{11} & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ 0 & d_{22} & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & d_{33} & \dots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & d_{nn} \end{bmatrix}
$$

### ▪ Uniform Stretching transformation

Consider the following :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{A}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
d_{11} & 0 \\
0 & d_{22}
\end{array}\right] \\
\\
\quad d_{11}=d_{22}>1
\end{gathered}
$$

Visually, it will look like the following:

![[Pasted image 20231227003221.png]]
The geometric interpretation of this transformation is:

> - An uniform stretching along both axis.
> - It performs the same amount of "stretch" along both axis because $d_{11}=d_{22}$ . 
> - It is a "stretching" transformation because $d_{11}=d_{22}>1$ .  
> - The exact value of $d_{ii}$ will determine the "amount of stretch". 
 
As an example consider the following matrix :

$$
\mathbf{A} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
0 & 2
\end{bmatrix}}_{\begin{align*}
& \quad \text{Stretch} \\ & \ \ \text{Factor}\rightarrow2
\end{align*}} 
$$

### ▪ Non-Uniform Stretching transformation

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\mathbf{A}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
d_{11} & 0 \\
0 & d_{22}
\end{array}\right] \\
\\
d_{11} \neq d_{22} \\
\\
d_{i i} \geq 1
\end{array}
$$

Visually, it will look like the following two diagrams: 

![[Pasted image 20231227025410.png]]
As an example consider the following matrix :

$$
\mathbf{A} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}}_{\begin{align*}
& \quad \text{Stretch} \\ & \ \ \text{Factor}\rightarrow2 \\ & \ \text{along x-axis}
\end{align*}} 
$$
Here, the vectors will get stretched by a factor of $2$ along the $x-axis$ and will stay constant along the $y-axis$.

As an example consider the following matrix :

$$
\mathbf{A} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 2
\end{bmatrix}}_{\begin{align*}
& \quad \text{Stretch} \\ & \ \ \text{Factor}\rightarrow2 \\ & \ \text{along y-axis}
\end{align*}} 
$$
Here, the vectors will get stretched by a factor of $2$ along the $y-axis$ and will stay constant along the $x-axis$.


The geometric interpretation of this transformation is:

> - An non-uniform stretching which is determined by the value of $d_{ii}$. 
> - It is a "stretching" transformation because $d_{ii} \geq 1$.
> - If both diagonal entries are equal to $1$ (violating $d_{11} \neq d_{22}$), then it transforms to an identity matrix.

### ▪ Uniform Shrinking Transformation

Consider the following :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}= & {\left[\begin{array}{cc}
d_{11} & 0 \\
0 & d_{22}
\end{array}\right] } \\
\\

& d_{11}=d_{22} \\
& 0<d_{i i}<1
\end{aligned}
$$

Visually, it will look like the following:

![[Pasted image 20231227011446.png]]
The geometric interpretation of this transformation is:

> - An uniform shrinking along both axis.
> -  It performs the same amount of "shrinkage" along both axis because $d_{11}= d_{22}$ .
> - It is a "shrinking" transformation because $0 < d_{ii}<1$ .
> - The exact value of $d_{ii}$ will determine the amount of shrinkage.

$$
\mathbf{A} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}}_{\begin{align*}
& \ \ \ \text{Shrinkage} \\ & \ \ \text{Factor}\rightarrow 0.5
\end{align*}} 
$$

### ▪ Non-Uniform Shrinking Transformation

$$
\begin{array}{r}
\mathbf{A}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
d_{11} & 0 \\
0 & d_{22}
\end{array}\right] \\
\\

d_{11} \neq d_{22} \\
\\
0<d_{i i} \leq 1
\end{array}
$$

Visually it will look like the following two diagrams:

![[Pasted image 20231227061146.png]]

As an example consider the following matrix :

$$
\mathbf{A} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
0.5 & 0 \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}}_{\begin{align*}
& \ \ \text{Shrinkage} \\ & \ \ \text{Factor}\rightarrow 0.5 \\ & \ \text{along x-axis}
\end{align*}} 
$$

![[Pasted image 20231227061209.png]]

As an example consider the following matrix :

$$
\mathbf{A} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0.5
\end{bmatrix}}_{\begin{align*}
& \ \ \text{Shrinkage} \\ & \ \ \text{Factor}\rightarrow 0.5 \\ & \ \text{along y-axis}
\end{align*}} 
$$
The geometric interpretation of this transformation is:

> - An non-uniform shrinking determined by  $d_{ii}$ .
> - It is a shrinking transformation because $0<d_{i i} \leq 1$

## Diagonal matrices | Reflection Transformations
---
To visualize these transformations we need to take into account the orientation of vectors. In addition, to visualize pure reflection without any scaling the absolute value of the diagonal elements need to be $1$.

**Reflection along y-axis:**

**Reflection along x-axis:**

**Reflection along both x and y-axis:**
