title: 1.3. Matrix Multiplication as Transformation
draft: false

In this section, I will go through different types of matrices and visualize what transformation happens when we apply that matrix to vectors. 

Obviously, this can be generalized to any vector space of $\mathbb{C}^n$. But for the ease of visualization I will keep it limited to $\mathbb{R}^2$.  In addition, based on the discussion in [[1.1. Matrix Vector Multiplication|Matrix Vector Multiplication]] and [[1.2. Linearity|Linearity]]  it is pretty obvious, we should give importance to the transformation of standard basis vectors.

**Other Online Interactive Tools to visualize:**

- [Linear Transformations Demo Applet by Lauren K Williams](https://www.integral-domain.org/lwilliams/Applets/algebra/linearTransformations.php)
- [Matrix Arcade by YI ZHE ANG](https://yizhe-ang.github.io/matrix-explorable//)

I think  playing with these tools is the best way to appreciate matrices as transformations.

## Identity matrix

$$
 I_n = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & \dots & 1 \end{bmatrix} 
$$
By definition, identity matrix is a square matrix with $1$ along the diagonals.
When we apply identity matrix to any vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$,  nothing actually happens and the vectors stays where it was originally. The reason behind that is, every column of the identity matrix is the standard basis vectors. 

## Diagonal matrices

A diagonal matrix has non-zero diagonal elements ($d_{ii}\neq 0$). All the off-diagonal elements are zero ($d_{ij}=0; i\neq j$). And, by definition we will consider it a square matrix.

$$
D = \begin{bmatrix} d_{11} & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ 0 & d_{22} & 0 & \dots & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & d_{33} & \dots & 0 \\ \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & d_{nn} \end{bmatrix}
$$

### Scaling Transformations 

#### Stretching transformation

Consider the following matrix:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{A}=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
d_{11} & 0 \\
0 & d_{22}
\end{array}\right] \\
\\
\quad d_{11}=d_{22}>1
\end{gathered}
$$

Visually, it will look like the following:

The geometric interpretation of this transformation is  an uniform stretching along both axis. It performs the same amount of "stretch" along both axis because $d_{11}=d_{22}$ and it is "stretching" because $d_{11}=d_{22}>1$ .  The exact value of $d_{ii}$ will determine the "amount of stretch". As an example:

$$
\mathbf{A} = \underbrace{\begin{bmatrix}
10 & 0 \\
0 & 10
\end{bmatrix}}_{\begin{align*}
&\text{Stretch} \\ &\text{Factor =10}
\end{align*}} 
$$
