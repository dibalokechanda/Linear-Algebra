title: 1.3. Matrix Multiplication as Transformation

In this section, I will go through different types of matrices and visualize what transformation happens when we apply that matrix to vectors. 

Obviously, this can be generalized to any vector space of $\mathbb{C}^n$. But for the ease of visualization I will keep it limited to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
