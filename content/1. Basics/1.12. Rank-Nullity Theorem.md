For a matrix $\mathbf{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ , the rank-nullity theorem states that:
$$
\operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Ker}(\mathbf{A}))+ \operatorname{dim}(\operatorname{Range(\mathbf{A})}) = \operatorname{dim}(\mathbb{R}^n)=n 

$$
By using the definition of rank and nullity this can be written as follows:

$$
\operatorname{Rank}(\mathbf{A})+\operatorname{nullity}(\mathbf{A})=n

$$
Interpret this is as follows :  There is a balance between rank and nullity of a matrix. In typical scenario we want a matrix to be high rank. Therefore, a higher rank matrix will have a low-dimensional null space. The converse is, a low rank rank will have a high dimensional null space. 

Visually it can be represented as follows:
