## First Definition 

A set of vectors $S=\{ \mathbf{v_{1}}, \mathbf{v_{2}},\cdots, \mathbf{v_{n}}\}$  is linearly independent if the following is true:

$$
\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v_{1}}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}+\cdots+\alpha_{n}\mathbf{v_{n}=0 }~\text{iff}~ \alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \cdots,\alpha_{n}=0
$$

To interpret this we just need to think about a counter example. Consider a set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}\}_{i}$ and another set of vectors $\{\mathbf{v}\}_{j}$ from $S$. Now if the linear combination of the first set of vectors is in direction opposition of the linear combination of vectors of the second set, the summation would result in  $\mathbf{0}$. That would mean there is a linear dependence. In what scenario there wouldn't be a linear dependence? 
If no vector (linear of combination of vectors) from $S$ can be expressed as a linear combination of any other vector/vectors.

**Example in** $\mathbb{R}^3$ :

For a concrete example, let's restrict ourselves to $\mathbb{R}^3$ and consider only three vectors i.e. $S=\{ \mathbf{v_{1}},\mathbf{v_{2}},\mathbf{v_{3}}\}$.

$$
\alpha_{1} \mathbf{v_1}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}+\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}=\mathbf{0}
$$
**Case 1:** Consider $\alpha_{1}=0$ and $\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3}\neq 0$,  

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}+\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}=\mathbf{0} \\
\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}=-\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}
\end{align}
$$
This means $\mathbf{v_{2}}$  and $\mathbf{v_{3}}$ are colinear or in other words lies along the same line. Furthermore, this implies, they are linearly dependent.

**Case 2:** Consider $\alpha_{2}=0$ and $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{3}\neq 0$,

$$
\begin{align}
\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v_{1}}+\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}=\mathbf{0} \\
\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v_{1}}=-\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}
\end{align}
$$

In this case, $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{3}}$ are colinear and linearly dependent.

**Case 3:** Consider $\alpha_{3}=0$ and $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\neq 0$,
$$
\begin{align}
\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v_{1}}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}=\mathbf{0} \\
\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v_{1}}=-\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}
\end{align}
$$
In this case, $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{2}}$ are colinear and linearly dependent.

**Case 4 :** Out of $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3}$  only one is non-zero and remaining two are zero. 

$$
\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v_{1}} \neq \mathbf{0}
$$
$$
\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}} \neq \mathbf{0}
$$
$$
\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}} \neq \mathbf{0}
$$
In this case, it is not possible to get a zero vector (without the trivial case).

**Case 5:**  Consider $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3} \neq 0$.

$$
\alpha_{1} \mathbf{v_1}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}=-\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}
$$
$$
\text{or}
$$
$$
\alpha_{2} \mathbf{v_2}+\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}=-\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v_{1}}
$$

$$
\text{or}
$$
$$
\alpha_{1} \mathbf{v_1}+\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}=-\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}
$$

This implies one of the vector can be written as a linear combination of two other vectors i.e. their is linear dependence.

This means the only way all three vectors will be linearly independent if and only if $\alpha_{1}=0,\alpha_{2}=0,\alpha_{3}=0$. Only in that case, $\alpha_{1} \mathbf{v_1}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{v_{2}}+\alpha_{3}\mathbf{v_{3}}=\mathbf{0}$ and all the vectors are linearly independent.

## Second Definition

Another definition which relates the linear independence to the concept of [[1.6. Span|Span]] is mentioned below. For any vector $\mathbf{v}_{i}\in S$ the following needs to hold true: 

$$
\mathbf{v}_i \notin \operatorname{Span}\left(S \backslash\left\{\mathbf{v}_i\right\}\right)
$$

We can form the definition for linear dependence as follows. For any vector $\mathbf{v}_{i}\in S$ if the following is true:

$$
\mathbf{v}_i \in \operatorname{Span}\left(S \backslash\left\{\mathbf{v}_i\right\}\right)
$$
This would mean there is a linear dependence between the vectors in $S$.
Following visualization show two such cases, where the set $S$ contains linearly dependent vectors.
