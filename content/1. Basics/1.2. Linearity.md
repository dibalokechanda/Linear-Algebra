The concept of linearity is a general concept. But I will keep it limited to linear transformation in context of functions and matrix multiplications.

## Linearity in Functions

Consider a function For linearity two different property need to hold. 

- Additivity: $f(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)$
- Homogeneity: $f(ax) = af(x)$

Now these two property can be combined into a single expression that holds if a function is linear:

$$
f(\alpha x+ \beta y) = \alpha f(x) + \beta f(y)
$$

## Linearity in terms of Matrix Multiplication

The map $\mathbf{x} \rightarrow f(\mathbf{x})$ is linear if for any $x,y \in \mathbb{C}^{n}$ and any $\alpha \in \mathbb{C}$,


$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y}) & =\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}+\mathbf{A} \mathbf{y} \\
\mathbf{A}(\alpha \mathbf{x}) & =\alpha \mathbf{A} \mathbf{x} 
\end{aligned}
$$
