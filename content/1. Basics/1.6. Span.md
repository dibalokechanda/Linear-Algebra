## Definition

Let $S$ be a set of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^n$. The $\text{span}(S)$ is the set of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that are a linear combination of vectors in $S$.  

This might sound a bit "formal" and hard to grasp. Just think of it this way; you are given a set of vectors from the vector space $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Now from that set of vectors you can generate new vectors by taking linear combination of them. Now, by taking every possible linear combinations you are going to get a resultant set of vectors. That resultant set of vectors is called the span of the original set of vectors you were given. 

Formally, consider a set of vectors $S:=\{ \mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2},\cdots,\mathbf{v_{n}}\}$

$$
\operatorname{span}(S)=\left\{\sum_{ \substack{\mathbf{v_i \in S}\\ \\\alpha_{i \in \mathbf{C}^n}}\\} \alpha_i \mathbf{v}_i \right\}
$$
