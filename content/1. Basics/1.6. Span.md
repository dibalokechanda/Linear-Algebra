## Definition

Let $S$ be a set of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^n$. The $\text{span}(S)$ is the set of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^n$ that are a linear combination of vectors in $S$.  

This might sound a bit "formal" and hard to grasp. Just think of it this way; you are given a set of vectors from the vector space $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. Now from that set of vectors you can generate new vectors by taking linear combination of them. Now, by taking every possible linear combinations you are going to get a resultant set of vectors. That resultant set of vectors is called the span of the original set of vectors you were given. 

Formally, consider a set of vectors $S:=\{ \mathbf{v_1}, \mathbf{v_2},\cdots,\mathbf{v_{n}}\}$

$$
\operatorname{span}(S)=\left\{\sum_{ \substack{\mathbf{v_i \in S}\\ \\\alpha_{i \in \mathbf{C}^n}}\\} \alpha_i \mathbf{v}_i \right\}
$$

## Visual intuition of Span 

The idea of span is closely related with [[1.7. Linear Independence|Linear independence]]. Let's start with a single vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$ vector space.

For a single vector $S=\{\mathbf{v_1}\}$, all we can do is perform scalar multiplication. This creates a infinite length line going through the origin which is $\text{span}(S)$ 

 But if we consider any two vectors in  $\mathbb{R}^2$ which are not parallel  or in other words, not in the span of each other, the span of these two vectors is the entire plane.

This means by taking the linear combination of $\mathbf{v_1}$ and $\mathbf{v_{2}}$ , we can generate any vector in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

But what if $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{2}}$ were along the same line ? What would happen then ?

That will mean $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ is in the span of $\mathbf{v_{2}}$. The converse is also true i.e. $\mathbf{v_{2}}$ is in the span of $\mathbf{v_{1}}$.  Any linear combination of these two vectors will only generate vectors that stays along a single line.  Another way to say it is $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{2}}$
are linearly dependent.

Consider the following visualization:

- In the first diagram,  the span of $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{2}}$ is a plane.
- In second diagram, we included another vector $\mathbf{v_{3}}$ , but  $\mathbf{v_{3}}$ is in the span of $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{2}}$.
- In the third diagram, $\mathbf{v_{3}}$ is not in the span of $\mathbf{v_{1}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{2}}$. Hence, $\mathbf{v_{1}}$, $\mathbf{v_{2}}$ and $\mathbf{v_{3}}$ are linearly independent to each other.
